THIS IS IMPLEMENTATION OF CACHE MEMORY WITH THREE DIFFERENT MAPPING METHODS INCLUDING FIFO REPLACEMENT METHOD WHEN CACHE CAPACITY IS REACHED !
CAPACITY MISSES SHOW THE NUMBER OF TIMES CAPACITY IS REACHED AND REPLACEMENT HAVE TO BE PERFORMED 
COLD MISSES SHOW THE NUMBER OF TIMES DATA IS NOT FOUND IN CACHE
HIT NUMBER IS SIMPLY NUMBER OF TIMES DATA FOUND SUCCESSFULLY
FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF FIFO REPLACEMENT METHOD I USED AN ARRAY IN WHICH I STORED THE INDEX_ADDR WHICH IS REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE INDEX PART THAT IS CONTAINED IN PHYSICAL ADDRESS .
TWO COUNTERS FOR KEEPING CURRENT INDEX OF FIFO ARRAY AND ONE FOR KEEPING NUMBER OF TIMES FIFO REPLACEMENT HAS BEEN USED .
THE ELEMENT WHICH WAS PLACED AT BEGINING TO THE FIFO ARRAY MUST BE REPLACED FIRST ... SO FIFO USED NO VARIABLE COMES HANDY FOR THIS PURPOSE .
